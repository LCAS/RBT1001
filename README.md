## Usage

### Setup your environment

1. Make sure you have VSCode installed: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
2. Make sure you have git installed: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
3. Make sure you have the `Docker` and the `Dev Containers` extension in VSCode installed and working: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/overview and https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers
    * ensure docker is working, i.e. try `docker run --rm hello-world` and check it succeeds for your user
4. The docker image used to provide the Development Container is provided by the [L-CAS](https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk) Container Registry. You must log in to use it. For simple read access, the username and password is public and is username `lcas`, password: `lincoln`. So, to log in do `docker login -u lcas -p lincoln lcas.lincoln.ac.uk` (you should only have to do this once, as the credentials should be cached unless your home directory is wiped).
