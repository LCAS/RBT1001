Launch ROS 2 controllers for the robot.

This script creates a launch description that starts the necessary controllers
for operating the robotic arm and gripper in a specific sequence.

Launched Controllers:
    1. Joint State Broadcaster: Publishes joint states to /joint_states
    2. Arm Controller: Controls the robot arm movements via /follow_joint_trajectory
    3. Gripper Action Controller: Controls gripper actions via /gripper_action

Launch Sequence:
    1. Joint State Broadcaster
    2. Arm Controller (starts after Joint State Broadcaster)
    3. Gripper Action Controller (starts after Arm Controller)
